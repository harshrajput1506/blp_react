          MD, D.A.B.P. (Diplomate of American Board of Pediatrics) <br />
          MBBS: from MGIMS, Sewagram, Wardha, India <br />
          Medical Residency in Pediatrics: Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Hospital,

          Munish Raizada moved to the USA in 2002 for higher training in
          Neonatology and thereafter had been practicing as a neonatologist
          doctor. In September 2023, he moved back to India to focus full time
          on politics.
          <br />
          Munish actively supported India Against Corruption (Anna aandolan) in
          2011-2012 and thereafter joined Aam Aadmi Party as a full time member
          in the hope to bring about Vyavastha Parivartan (overhaul of system).
          However, true to his core, he opposed the move of the party to shield
          donorsâ€™ list (thereby killing the principle of financial integrity).
          And In Nov 2015, the party suspended him when he openly criticized AAP
          for supporting Laloo Prasad Yadav during the Bihar assembly elections
          of 2015.
          <br />
          In 2019, Munish worked on directing and producing a 7 episodes web
          series called Transparency: Pardarshita that chronicles the inside and
          UNTOLD stories of IAC and AAP. It also has 2 beautiful songs. A must
          watch, the web series is available now on YouTube.
          <br />
          Last many years, Munish has been focusing on studying the ills of
          democracy in India and abroad. With the international experience of
          observing democracies, he has now embarked upon the journey of
          creating a political organization that aims to deliver models of good
          governance and upgrading democracy via various reforms.
