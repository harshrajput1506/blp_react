              President, Bharatiya Liberal Party (BLP) <br />
              MD, D.A.B.P. (Diplomate of American Board of Pediatrics) <br />
              MBBS: from MGIMS, Sewagram, Wardha, India <br />
              Medical Residency in Pediatrics: Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Hospital, New York, USA. <br />
              Fellowship in Neonatology: John H Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, IL, USA

            <div className="text-lg opacity-80 mt-4">
              Dr. Munish Raizada moved to the USA in 2002 for higher training in Neonatology and thereafter had been practicing as a neonatologist doctor. In September 2023, he moved back to India to focus full time on politics.
              <br />
              Munish actively supported India Against Corruption (Anna Aandolan) in 2011-2012 and thereafter joined Aam Aadmi Party as a full-time member in the hope to bring about Vyavastha Parivartan (overhaul of system). However, true to his core, he opposed the move of the party to shield donorsâ€™ list (thereby killing the principle of financial integrity). And In Nov 2015, the party suspended him when he openly criticized AAP for supporting Laloo Prasad Yadav during the Bihar assembly elections of 2015.
              <br />
              In 2019, Dr. Munish worked on directing and producing a 7-episode web series called Transparency: Pardarshita that chronicles the inside and UNTOLD stories of IAC and AAP. It also has 2 beautiful songs. A must-watch, the web series is available now on YouTube.
              <br />
              Last many years, Dr. Munish has been focusing on studying the ills of democracy in India and abroad. With the international experience of observing democracies, he has now embarked upon the journey of creating a political organization (Bharatiya Liberal Party) that aims to deliver models of good governance and upgrading democracy via various reforms.
